# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
})
```

# Hangman Game üéÆ

Welcome to the **Hangman** game project! This is a fun, interactive Hangman game that I've developed to test both vocabulary and coding skills. It brings the classic game to life with some modern twists and my personal touch.

## Introduction ‚ú®

**Hangman** is a word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. I built this project as a way to merge my love for coding with the challenge of creating a fun, logic-driven game.

---

## Features üöÄ

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Guess letters and see the stick figure gradually appear as incorrect guesses are made.
- **Word Categories**: Play with various word categories like movies, fruits, animals, and more!
- **Responsive Design**: The game works on all devices, whether you're on desktop or mobile.
- **Personal Touch**: Sleek, minimalistic design that represents my coding style.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

Follow these steps to run the game locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Shah-Namra/Hangman.git
  ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
  ```
  cd Hangman
  ```
3.  **Install necessary dependencies:**
  ```
  npm install
  ```
4. **Install additional library (for particle animations):**
  ```
  npm install react-tsparticles
  ```
5. **Run the app:**
  ```
  npm start
  ```

## How to Play üïπÔ∏è
1. Open the game in your browser.
2. Select a word category.
3. Guess the hidden word one letter at a time.
4. For each wrong guess, a part of the stick figure is drawn.
5. Win by guessing the word before the entire stick figure is drawn!

## TODO üìù
1. IMP : Add Word section not working, entered words are used in game.
1. Install and configure react-tsparticles for background.
2. Remove the footer and add helpful info section which contains links, credits etc.
3. Fix the stick figure drawing issue.
4. Change background color for better visual appeal.
5. Fix the layout issue where Hangman Drawing goes outside the box at 770px screen width.
6. Try to implement a dual or tri-color theme for the website, giving it a modern and professional feel.
